<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">The
portion of code that I will be discussing is the Tool Factory for the
Mia application. This iteration required a lot of code re-factoring,
which left us with FlashPhoto and Mia as separate applications
sharing a library of common C++ and header files. One of Mia's unique
specifications is that it only uses two tools, while FlashPhoto
includes a handful. This meant that we could not use the same Tool
Factory file for both FlashPhoto and Mia, leaving us with
ToolFactoryMia and ToolFactoryFlash. The following is the C++ file
for ToolFactoryMia, followed by its header file:</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<pre class="western">#include &quot;ToolFactoryMia.h&quot;
#include &quot;libphoto.h&quot;
int ToolFactory::getNumTools() 
{
        return NUMTOOLS;
}


Tool* ToolFactory::createTool(int toolID) 
{
        Tool* tool = NULL;
        
        switch (toolID) {
                case TOOL_PEN:
                        tool = new TPen();
                        break;
        case TOOL_STAMP:
            tool = new TStamp();
            break;
                default:
                        tool = NULL;
                        break;
        }
        
        return tool;

You may notice that these pieces of code look very similar to
FlashPhoto's Tool Factory.  This is the case because Mia has borrowed
the Pen and Stamp features from FlashPhoto.  Tools such as Eraser,
Spray Can, Calligraphy Pen and Highlighter have simply been removed
from these files.  We have decided to leave the name of the class
itself unchanged.  Both FlashPhoto and Mia refer to the ToolFactory
class in their respective code, but they will not conflict because
they reside in separate directories.  If we were to change the name
of the class, we would need to make changes in some of our other
files.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">As far as coding
style goes, we have left comments where we feel they are appropriate.
These particular pieces of code are not terribly difficult to
understand, so we made sure not to use too many comments in my code. 
In fact, the only comment we have made here is one explaining the
main function of the class.  Notice how this comment is wrapped with
/** */.  By wrapping this around the comment's text, the comment will
show up in our Doxygen generated documentation.  Please use this
method when making comments anywhere in the source code.  Another
styling point that we would like to make note of is bracket
placement. Take the following line of code for example: 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Liberation Mono, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">enum
TOOLS </font></font>
</p>
<pre class="western"><font face="Liberation Mono, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">{</font></font>
        <font face="Liberation Mono, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">TOOL_PEN = 0,</font></font>
<font face="Liberation Mono, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">TOOL_STAMP,</font></font>
        <font face="Liberation Mono, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">NUMTOOLS</font></font>
<font face="Liberation Mono, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">};</font></font></pre><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
<br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Notice how the
brackets are lined up nicely under 'enum'.  This is one of multiple
bracket placement methods, and we have chosen to use this one
throughout our code for the sake of cohesion.  The piece of code
could also have been written in the following format:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Liberation Mono, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">enum
TOOLS  {</font></font></p>
<pre class="western">        <font face="Liberation Mono, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">TOOL_PEN = 0,</font></font>
<font face="Liberation Mono, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">TOOL_STAMP,</font></font>
        <font face="Liberation Mono, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">NUMTOOLS</font></font>
<font face="Liberation Mono, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">};</font></font>
</pre><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
While this format saves a line of code, we find that the format in
the first example looks cleaner and is much easier to read.  Please
follow this format when contributing to the source code of FlashPhoto
and Mia.</p>
