<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">When writing a
program of any size, it is very important to keep with a common
style. This will not only make it easier for you, but also for those
developing for the project in the future. One styling point that is
particularly important is spacing. Take the following line of code
for example:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">if (imageFile.find(&quot;.jpg&quot;, imageFile.size() - 5) != std::string::npos)</pre><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
You could easily write something like this as follows: 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">if(imageFile.find(&quot;.jpg&quot;,imageFile.size()-5)!=std::string::npos)</pre><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
Notice how the second example is a bit harder to read and looks very
scrunched together. By using spacing where appropriate, you can make
your code much easier to read and work with. This is just one of many
important aspects of coding style. We can also see our bracket
placement convention in the following piece of code. Notice how the
are both directly lined up with the 'i' in 'if'. This is a very
common way to place your statement and function brackets. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<pre class="western">        //Check for valid .jpg extension
        if (imageFile.find(&quot;.jpg&quot;, imageFile.size() - 5) != std::string::npos)
        {
                //We have a jpg image, so call the appropriate jpg load function
                cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Image extension is .jpg&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
                image = JPGImage::load(imageFile);
        }</pre><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
One could also write the statement as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<pre class="western">        //Check for valid.jpg extension
        if (imageFile.find(&quot;.jpg&quot;, imageFile.size() - 5) != std::string::npos) {
                //We have a jpg image, so call the appropriate jpg load function
                cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Image extension is .jpg&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
                image = JPGImage::load(imageFile);
        }</pre><p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">
This is also a very common way to place your brackets, but we have
chosen to go the route of that in the first example.  We have also implemented a naming a few naming conventions for particular classes.  Take tools for example.  Each tool file starts with 'T'.  The same goes for filters, so blur tool files would be named 'TBlur.*', and blur tool files would be named 'FBlur.*'.  This really helps to organize the code nicely in a directory.  With this naming convention in place, all tools will be grouped together, as well as filters.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Documentation</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Another
important aspect of style is commenting your code. Comments help to
better explain what is going on in your code. It is important to
leave useful comments in your code where you feel necessary, but be
wary of overdoing it. Too many comments can clutter the code. Notice
that we have clearly indicated what the piece of code is doing with 
</font><font face="Liberation Mono, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">//Check
for valid .jpg extension.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">We then confirm the
condition in which we execute the following statements with <font face="Liberation Mono, monospace"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">//We
have a jpg image, so call the appropriate jpg load function.  </font></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">This
piece of code is relatively self explanatory, and does not need any
additional comments. </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Please be sure to
follow our styling and commenting conventions when adding your work
to our code.</p>
