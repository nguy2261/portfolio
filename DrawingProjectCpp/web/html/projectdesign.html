<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">When designing our
project, we wanted to keep things as organized as possible and with
as little repetition as possible. Because we have two applications
that are sharing classes, it would have been easy to reuse their
shared files into their own separate directories. What we have done
is created a library of common classes between FlashPhoto and Mia.
Both programs link to this library, 'libphoto.a', upon compilation.
This eliminates wasted space form duplicate files. We have also
implemented tool and filter factories into our design. These
factories make it much easier for new developers to add their own
personal tools or filters to either program. The following is a
UML-like diagram to illustrate major classes so that new developers
can quickly understand the structure of our project:</p>
